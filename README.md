# distributed-working-cop



This is the github for the distributed working COP. This repo is for people to add best practices and use cases for distributed working. This is not to replace the OPL and any new practices should be added to that as appropriate following the steps found here [Open Practice Contributing](https://openpracticelibrary.com/page/contribution-guide/).

This is for people to share their own experiences of the practices how they have used them in the real world and what practices they have looped together to perform successful deliveries.

Please refrain from putting any customer/confidential information into this repo as it will be publicly accessible.
